# Assignment-5
'''
   This is Assignment-5 where I've used cnn for handwritten digit recognition from mnist dataset.
   Most of this work has its roots from this source:https://machinelearningmastery.com/handwritten-digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-python-keras/
   I've changed the number of epochs and that resulted in an improved accuracy
   I've changed the number of convoluted layers and that too resulted in an improvised accuracy
